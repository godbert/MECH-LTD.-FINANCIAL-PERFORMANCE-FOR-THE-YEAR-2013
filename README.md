# MECH-LTD.-FINANCIAL-PERFORMANCE-FOR-THE-YEAR-2013
Analyzed with aim to look into the expenses and revenue income to help improve the company performance for the coming year and below are my findings &amp; actionable recommendations.

INSIGHTS:

• Top Expense Category: Marketing, with total expenses close to £93K.
Top Revenue Category: Service Income, generating approximately £280K.
This suggests a strong focus on service-based revenue streams but potentially high spending on marketing activities.


• Profit fluctuates throughout the year, peaking in August at £73K and dipping in certain months like January (£44K) and October (£32K).
August and December show strong performance, while early and late quarters see lower profit levels.


• The Marketing department leads in revenue, generating £247.82K, followed closely by HR and Operations, with around £229K and £235.2K, respectively.
This indicates that Marketing not only has high expenses but also substantial revenue contributions, suggesting potential positive returns on marketing investment.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

• Given the high spending in the Marketing category, Mech Ltd. should analyze the return on investment (ROI) for each marketing campaign. Consider reallocating budget to high-performing campaigns and cutting back on less effective ones.
Additionally, explore cost-effective marketing channels, such as digital marketing, which may yield high returns with lower upfront costs.


• While Service Income is the top revenue generator, there is potential to increase income from Product Sales and Consulting. Mech Ltd. could consider product diversification, upselling opportunities, and expanding consulting services.
For consistent growth, the company should also explore ways to scale Investment Income and Licensing, which are less resource-intensive revenue sources.


• Insurance and Travel are substantial expense categories. The company could look for competitive insurance providers to reduce costs and implement travel policies to limit non-essential travel.
Reviewing Office Supplies expenses for unnecessary purchases and negotiating better rates with suppliers could also reduce costs in this category.
